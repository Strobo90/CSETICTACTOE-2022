# CSETICTACTOE-2022
TICTACETOE
 This is a fun game to play
 This is the first project I ever worked on using C#
  I earned how to use version control from this program. 
  I made changes at diffrent stages to my project on my desktop  and learned how to push them to my repository. I aso saw how the changes were trace and timed. 
  My class partner can colaborate with me on this and many project I wil do in the future on this platfrom. 
  It was challenging at first but now C# is starting to get exciting.
